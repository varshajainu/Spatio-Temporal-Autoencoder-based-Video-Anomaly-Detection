# Spatio-Temporal-Autoencoder-based-Video-Anomaly-Detection
This project involves a multi-step process: first, videos are converted into frames using FFmpeg, and then each frame is further converted into cuboids, which are organized into separate folders. Subsequently, a spatio-temporal autoencoder is trained for each cuboid folder individually.
